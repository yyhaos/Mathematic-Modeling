My team chose B probem to solve.
B requirs a model to explain the relationship between price of the shares, risk of time and transaction.
See pdf for solution.

Dealing the data is hard. 
Firstly save the excel in txt, using utf coding.(hard to open the excel for C)
Then use C to build a Data stack and ouput the data required.(see Bdata_deal.cpp)

Then goes the model implementation (see model)
includes 1 main part(Simulate.m) and 3 functions(danger.m, Price_Pridict.m, Wait_time.m)
need to import the data from Bdata_deal.cpp.
