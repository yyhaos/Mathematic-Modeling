### The second time I take part in MCM/ICM.

Four days hard work:  
1 choice the problem D, do the research, deal the data.  
2 start to write the profile and create the module while dealing with the data.  
3 continue to create the module(from zero). Start to do some translation and do the fitting/dealing with more data, and prediction, draw graphs.  
4 translation, check the predictions, review the works.    
4.5 submit and sleep

## Feeling
Programing in analysis the passing and running data. 

It is hard to communicate with each other far away. I mean remote communication (influenced by the COVR, can't go back 2 college).

Worked with two girls (I dominated).  
Most of the participants are Chinese, just have fun :)
