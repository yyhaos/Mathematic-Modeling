## 2018.2.9
### The first time I take part in MCM/ICM.

Four days hard work:  
1 choice the problem C, do the research, processing the data.  
2 start to write the profile and create the module while dealing with the data.  
3 continue to create the module(from zero). Start to do some translation and do the fitting/dealing with more data, and prediction, draw graphs.  
4 translation, check the predictions, review the works.    
4.5 submit and sleep  

## Result  No.72819
### Form zero to M prize.  
(just pretend to solve problems)

## Feeling
No program at all(if u call processing data/drawing graphs/fitting lines with Excel/Matlab is programming, u own it)  
Maybe it would be better to work with some girls.  
Most of the participants are Chinese, just have fun :)
