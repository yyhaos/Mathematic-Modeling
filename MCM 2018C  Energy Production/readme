2018.2.9
The first time I take part in MCM/ICM.

Four days hard work:
1 choice the problem C, do the research, deal the data.
2 start to write the profile and create the modle while dealing with the data.
3 continue to create the moudle(from zero). Start to do some translation and do the fitting/dealing with more data, and pridiction, draw graphs.
4 translation, cheak the pridictions, review the works.
4.5 submit and sleep

Result  72819
Form zero to M prize.
(just pretend to solve problems)

Feeling
No program at all(if u call dealing data/drawing graphs/fitting lines with Excel/Matlab is programming, u own it)
Maybe it would be better to work with girls.
Most of the participants are Chinese, just have fun :)
